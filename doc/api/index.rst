The PyMongo distribution contains three top-level packages for
interacting with MongoDB. `bson` is an implementation of the
`BSON format <http://bsonspec.org>`_, `pymongo` is a
full-featured driver for MongoDB, and `gridfs` is a set of tools
for working with the `GridFS
<http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/GridFS+Specification>`_ storage
specification.
